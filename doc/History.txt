This is probably the last major revision of CrashMail. I put this release
together mainly since I had some good code that I had written a long time
ago that had never made it into a released version of CrashMail. I felt that
that code was too good to waste and so now it finally is incorporated into
CrashMail along with some other improvements.

If you are using CrashMail, please send me an e-mail (billing@df.lth.se).
I am curious about how many CrashMail users there still are...


Changes in version 0.7

 - Implemented a message filter. Using this feature, you can filter out messages
   that match specified criteria and perform a number of commands on them. This
   filter will for example copy echomail messages addressed to me to a special
   area (the area needs to be configured as a local area using LOCALAREA):

    FILTER SOURCE=TOSSED and TYPE=ECHOMAIL and TONAME="Johan Billing"
    COPY PERSONAL_MESSAGES

   See doc/filter.txt for a complete description of the new message filter.

 - The new message filter replaces the configuration keywords ROBOTNAME, REMAP
   and REMAPNODE since the message filter can perform these tasks.

   Replacement for ROBOTNAME <name> <command>:

    FILTER TYPE=NETMAIL and TOLOCALAKA and TONAME=<name>
    EXECUTE <command>

   Replacement for REMAP <pattern> <new name> <destination pattern>

    FILTER TYPE=NETMAIL and TOLOCALAKA and TONAME=<pattern>
    REMAPMSG <new name> <destination pattern>

   Replacement for REMAPNODE <node pattern> <destination pattern>

    FILTER TYPE=NETMAIL and TOADDR=<node pattern>
    REMAPMSG "*" <destination pattern>

 - Rewrote the dupe-checking. CrashMail now no longer needs to load the entire
   dupe buffer into memory. This means that you now can keep a much large dupe
   buffer without using a lot of memory.

   CrashMail will not read your old dupe file, you have to delete it.

   Also note that the second argument for DUPEFILE has changed from the size
   of the dupe buffer in KB to the maximum number of messages that should be
   stored in the dupe buffer. If you don't update your configuration, you  will
   only have a very small dupe buffer.

 - CrashMail no longer keeps zero-length files in the packet directory for use
   in naming new bundles. Instead it relies solely on the cmindex file.

 - CrashMail now also supports nodelists in the Version 7+ format in addition
   to its own format. (Note: It seems like the Linux version of FastLst does
   not include hub/region in the compiled nodelist for some reason. This means
   that node patterns with HUB/REGION won't work.)

 - New tool in the CrashMail suite: crashlistout. This tool can list your
   outbound directory in a pretty way.

 - New configuration keywords: BEFORETOSS and BEFOREPACK. You can use these
   to execute custom commands before tossing/packing a *.pkt file.

 - New keyword PKTFROM in node configuration. You can use this if you want
   to set the originating address of .pkt files to something other than the
   default.

 - New configuration switches: FLOWCRLF and NOEXPORTNETMAIL. FLOWCRLF makes
   CrashMail use CRLF as end-of-line characters in flow files instead of
   just LF. NOEXPORTNETMAIL makes CrashMail ignore netmail areas with
   SCAN and SCANLIST. This together with NOROUTE makes it possible to use
   an external program for handling netmail.

 - New switch NEEDSPLUS for the REMOTEAF keyword.

 - New commandline argument: SCANDOTJAM. This can be used for scanning areas
   listed in echomail.jam/netmail.jam files.

 - In addition to "programname ?", you can now also use -h, --help, help, /?
   and /h with CrashMail and the related utilities to show the commandline help.

 - Improved the time it takes for CrashMail to load the configuration file.
   Only noticable if you have a huge number of pass-through areas.

 - Fixed some bugs found in the ChangeLog from CrashEcho (thanks guys!)

   - SCANLIST does not abort anymore if an area cannot be scanned

   - RESCAN was broken and always returned an "unknown area" error

   - Added sanity checks to JAM linking to prevent CrashMail from crashing
     on messagebases with broken reply links

   - Fixed some memory leaks in the JAM handling.

 - Upgraded JAMLIB to version 1.3.1

 - Some minor cosmetic changes.

 - Cleaned up the source in various places.
 

Changes in version 0.62:

 CrashMail

 - CrashMail would check packet passwords even if the command-line option
   NOSECURITY was used. Fixed.

 - The Local flag is now cleared and the Sent flag is set before messages
   are imported to the messagebase. In previous versions of CrashMail,
   imported messages with Local flag and no Sent flag were re-exported the
   next time CrashMail SCAN was run. Fixed.

 - CrashMail no longer leaves empty lines in the config file when areas are
   removed by the AreaFix.

 CrashMaint

 - CrashMaint used local time instead of UTC when deleting old messages in
   JAM areas. This could cause messages to be deleted ahead of time. Thanks
   to Alexander S Aganichev for noticing this and sending me a patch.

 JAMLIB

 - There was a bug in JAMLIB that caused the Linux version of CrashMail to fail
   when trying to import an empty message to the messagebase. The bug has been
   fixed and CrashMail now uses the new version of JAMLIB.


Changes in version 0.61:

 CrashMail:

 - CrashMail incorrectly bounced netmails to nodes listed as hold in the
   nodelist are no longer bounced. Fixed. Netmails to nodes listed as down
   are still bounced.

 - The CrashMail REMOVE command didn't work. Fixed.

 - The AreaFix would sometimes miss some areas when you unsubscribed to areas
   using patterns.

 - The AreaFix no longer crashes when it tries to remove areas after the
   feed has unsubscribed to them.

 - JAM_LINK and JAM_HIGHWATER would turn on both linking and the use of
   highwater marks. Fixed.

 - TINYSEENBY didn't work. Fixed.

 - CrashMail had problems with backslashes in file-attaches. Fixed.

 JAMLIB

 - Changed to latest version of JAMLIB.

 CrashWrite:

 - PKTFROMADDR/PKTTOADDR didn't work. Fixed.

 - CrashWrite had problems with paragraphs longer than 100 characters. Fixed.


Changes in version 0.6

 CrashMail:

 - The AreaFix no longer truncates area names longer than 30 characters in
   the response messages.

 - The Linux version of CrashMail now shows the real return code (using
   WEXITSTATUS()) when an external command returns an error.

 - Two default areas may now have the same path

 - Cleaned up the Makefiles

 - CrashMail no longer sets the Sent flag on all imported message. CrashMail
   now only exports messages with the Local flag set and the Sent flag cleared.

 - CrashMail can now also export JAM messages with very long kludges without
   problems. Previous versions had problems with kludges longer than 200 chars.

 - LF characters are stripped when importing messsages to a JAM messagebase.

 - Space characters are stripped in AreaFix commands. This means that AreaFix
   commands will work even if they begin with one or several space characters.

 - Node numbers can now be abbreviated on the EXPORT lines. See example.prefs
   for an example on how this works. Thanks to Per Lundberg for idea and
   original patch.

 - You can now define local areas in crashmail.prefs using the keyword
   LOCALAREA. Local areas are not used by CrashMail, but are included in config
   files created by CrashExport and are maintained when running CrashMaint.

 CrashWrite:

 - There are two new options PKTFROMADDR and PKTTOADDR that can be used to
   set the origin and destination address to something other than the origin
   and destination address of the message inside the packet.

 - A new option PASSWORD that can be used to set the password of the created
   packet.

 JAMLIB:

 - JAMLIB could crash on corrupt messagebases. Fixed.

 - JAMLIB lo longer reads or writes structures directly from/to disk. This
   makes JAMLIB even more portable and ensures that the Intel byte-order will
	be used on all platforms regardless of the processor used.

 All programs:

 - The Win32 version of CrashMail did not work if you were tossing mail to
   many downlinks since you could only open a limited number of files with
   fopen() (about 40). Because of this, the Win32 version has been rewritten
   to use Windows' I/O functions rather than the standard C stdio. The problem
   is solved and the Win32 version is now also slightly faster. Note that
   JAMLIB still uses fopen() so do not use too high a value for JAM_MAXOPEN.

 - Improved the error messages in all programs. Now CrashMail will also
   tell you why an I/O error occurred using the response given by the
   operating system. (To do this, the functions osError() and osErrorMsg()
   were added to oslib.)

 - Added function osVFPrintf() to oslib

 - Changed error message "Too many arguments" in command line parsing to
   to "Unknown keyword %s". This should make it easier to find the
   problem.

 - Several cosmetic changes to program output and source code


Changes in version 0.52

 CrashMail:

 - Three new flags for the NODE keyword: CRASH, DIRECT and HOLD. With these
   flags, you can set the priority for packed and unpacked netmail.

 - When the packet directory was missing, the error message said that the
   outbound directory was missing. This could be very confusing. Fixed.

 - Fixed a Y2K-related bug in the JAM import function.

 - Node patterns with REGION or HUB did not work for points. Fixed.

 - Added the new %-code %R for the ROBOTNAME keyword. %R gives the message
   in RFC-format with the addresses in RFC-format (name@pX.fX.nX.zX.domain).

 - When importing messages, CrashMail now checks for robot and AreaFix names
   before messages are remapped. If you want to remap messages to AreaFix, you
   have to make sure that no AreaFix names are configured. REMAPNODE still
   works as before.

 - CrashMail now updates the DateProcessed field when exporting messages from
   a JAM area.

 - CrashMail no longer is so strict with names of packet files names. Packet
   names are now considered valid even if they contain non-hexadecimal
   characters.

 - When glibc 2.1 was used, the Linux version of CrashMail exported messages
   from JAM messagebases with an incorrect date. The time was one hour ahead.
   This has now been fixed.

 - Dates in Via lines were one month early. Fixed.

 - If a netmail area had an IMPORT line, all netmails would be imported to
   that area. This has been fixed and IMPORT now works as intended.

 - CrashMail no longer aborts if a JAM area could not be opened when exporting
   messages. CrashMail instead continues and exports mail from all other areas.

 - CrashMail used to create an invalid configuration file when auto-adding
   areas to a config file where the last line did not end with an end-of-line
   character. This has now been fixed.

 - You can now use the environment variable CMCONFIGFILE to set the default
   configuration file for CrashMail.

 - CrashMail would incorrectly import FMPT kludges to JAM areas. Fixed.

 CrashExport:
 
 - CrashExport did not write netmail areas correctly to a GoldED configuration
   file. This has now been fixed.

 - CrashExport can now also create en area configuration file for timEd.

 - CrashExport no longer exports areas with the UNCONFIRMED keyword.
 
 CrashStats:
 
 - The total number of messages per day were not calculated correctly in the
   LAST7 mode, instead a random number would be shown. The average total number 
   of messages per day was also incorrect.  These bugs have now been fixed.

 CrashMaint:

 - You can now use the environment variable CMCONFIGFILE to set the default
   configuration file for CrashMail.

 All programs:
 
 - The argument parsing has been improved. The main change for the user is that
   "programname ?" now gives a more helpful output.

 - The functions remove(), rename() and system() has been moved to the oslib.
   This change should not be noticable for the user.

 - Peter Karlsson has prepared man-pages for CrashMail and all related tools.
   Thanks, Peter! These are handy under Linux, but can also be used on other
   platforms if you install a "man"-program.

 - Peter Karlsson has ported CrashMail II to OS/2. Thanks, Peter!


Changes in version 0.5

 CrashMail:

 - Because of a bug in the pattern matching, an empty string would match any
   pattern. Fixed.

 - Areas belonging to the same group were not listed together in the area lists
   generated by the Areafix.

 - CrashMail showed the same error message twice when the packer returned an
   error when unarchiving a bundle. Fixed.

 - If the highwater mark was lower than the lowest messagenumber in a JAM area,
   CrashMail would still try to export messages beginning from the highwater
   mark. Unfortunately this would cause a crash because of another bug
   that appeared when CrashMail tried to export an unreadable message.
   All this has now been fixed.

 - CrashMail no longer stops exporting when it encounters an unreadable message

 - CrashMail no longer adds its own node number to the path if it already
   exists as the last node in the path lines.

 - CrashMail could sometimes create circular reply links and get caught in
   infinite loops when dupes were imported to a JAM messagebase. Fixed.

 - New config option: ALLOWKILLSENT

 - New command-line keyword for CrashMail: TOSSDIR
	
 - New command-line keyword for CrashMail: NOSECURITY. If this keyword is
   used, all packets will be tossed without security checks. This is mainly 
   intended to be used together with TOSSFILE/TOSSDIR and packets
   generated by CrashWrite.
	
 CrashMaint:

 - CrashMaint no longer checks the ActiveMsgs counter in the JAM messagebase
   to determine if the area needs to be packed. This check did not always work,
   among other things because all programs did not update the counter
   properly. JAM areas are now always packed when "crashmaint pack" is
   used.

 - CrashMaint now rebuilds the ActiveMsgs counter when packing a JAM area.

 - CrashMaint did not update the messagebase header when removing all messages
   from a JAM area. This would cause some messages not to be exported when 
   highwater marks were used. (If you suspect that this has happened to
   you, remove all *.cmhw files.)
	
 - Improved the error handling a bit in CrashMaint. Now you get an error if 
   an area couldn't be updated since it was in use by another program.

 CrashWrite:
 
 - Included CrashWrite, a new tool for CrashMail. CrashWrite reads a text
   file and then creates a packet file that can be tossed by CrashMail.

 CrashExport:

 - CrashAreasBBS and CrashForward have been replaced by the new program
   CrashExport. In addition to the old formats, CrashExport can also
   create arealists in GoldED format. The old version of CrashAreasBBS had
   some trouble with pass-through areas, this is gone in CrashExport.


Changes in version 0.42

 - Fixed bug that occurred when sending mail to nodes with long addresses
   (e.g. 9999:8888/7777.6666)

 - Fixed an error message in the outbound handling

 - Fixed a bug that occurred when auto-adding pass-through areas

 - Fixed a small memory leak

 - CrashMail got caught in an infinite loop when an unknown nodelist format
   was specified in the config. This is now fixed.
	
 - CrashMail no longer segfaults at startup when pass-through areas are used!

 - CrashMail now adds packets to bundles in the correct order
 
 - CrashMail would under some circumstances use the same bundle for more than
   one node. This has been fixed and a mechanism that checks that the same
   bundle is not used for more than one node has been added.

 - Routing did not work properly when BOUNCEPOINTS was turned on. Fixed.

 - Removed an unnecessary linebreak from the bounce messages.

 - New configuration keyword: NOMAXOUTBOUNDZONE. See example.prefs for more
   information.

 - CrashList did not handle Pvt nodes correctly. Fixed.

 - There was a small mistake in the example configuration file. The keyword is
   REMOTEAF, not REMOTEAREAFIX.


Changes in version 0.4

 - First public release
